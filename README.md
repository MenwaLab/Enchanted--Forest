# Enchanted Forest´s Maze 

## Description
Once upon a time, the beautiful and peaceful forest of Sylvaria was cursed by an evil dark entity, transforming it into a dark, magical maze with dangerous traps. Players must navigate this maze, compete against each other, and find the exit—a shining star that promises freedom. Along the way, you'll encounter traps designed to harm you, magical cells to aid you, and a random teleportation spot that could either help or hinder your progress.

While navigating the maze, you must outwit your opponent and deal with traps, the other player´s abilities, and unexpected twists. But beware—only one player can escape, so you must hurry before your rival gets the upper hand!

The king and queen are trapped inside the maze too and will offer assistance when you cross their paths. But be careful of the invisible area that teleports you to a random spot in the maze. Will you make it to the exit first, or will you fall victim to the maze's cruel tricks?

Good luck, and may the best player win!
